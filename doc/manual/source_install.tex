\subsection{Installing from source}
\label{sec:source-install}

We have tried to make installing \map{} from source as simple as possible.  
There are four steps:


\begin{enumerate}
  \item Download the source
  \item Download and install map3d's external dependencies
  \item Setup the make configuration
  \item Compile
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Download Source Code}
You can get the \map{} source code from the \map{} download page at 
\htmladdnormallink{\texttt{http://www.sci.utah.edu/software/map3d.html}}
{http://www.sci.utah.edu/software/map3d.html}.  Login and work your way
to the \map{} version \version{} download page, and download 
the source code.

\subsubsection{Install Dependencies}
You will need to install \map{}'s Qt development environment for 5.4 or greater.
For Windows, Linux, and Mac, this is usually pretty straightforward.  The Qt archives
are located at \htmladdnormallink{https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.4/5.4.0/} {https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.4/5.4.0/}

\subsubsection{Configuring \map{}}
You should not have to change much in order to get \map{} to compile.
MatlabIO (one of \map{}'s dependents) needs to know where ZLIB is
(required, and should be installed after completing the previous section),
and \map{} needs to know where Qt is.  The included files show samples of
how this is to be done, and following are specific details.

Usually all that needs to be done is to invoke qmake and make. These procedures
have been wrapped in a script for both Windows and Mac, see the README file at
the root of \map{}'s download page.

Windows is set up to use Visual Studio 2015 with Qt 5.4.0, both in 64-bit mode.
Windows ZLIB binaries are included in the source distribution.

Remember for \map{} to run, you should probably add \map{} to your path.
If, when you run \map{} see errors like ``Cannot load library Qt5Core.dll''
or ``Cannot map so libQt5Core.so.5'', then you need to add the Qt libraries
to your runtime path.
