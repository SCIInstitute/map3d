\section{Installation}

\subsection{System requirements}

\map{} is written in standard C/C++ and uses the OpenGL and Qt, both choices made to ensure broad portability of the program.

Note: As of \map{} 7.1 or greater, Qt version 5.4.0 or greater is required
to run \map{}.  Please update your dependencies according the the 
Windows, Linux, or Mac sections below.

  \begin{description}
    \item [All platforms: ]  OpenGL now comes standard on most systems.  
          Instructions on how to install Qt are described in detail below
          based on which platform you are installing.
          described below\mbox{}\\

          \begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
            \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Requirements for all systems.  } \\ \hline
          OpenGL libraries (GL and GLU) & version 1.1 +
     \footnote{A plus sign, ``+'', indicates ``or better''}\\

          \end{center}

            
    \item [Linux (i386): ] we do not supply binaries for Linux, but \map{} should 
	       be able to be built from source.
	       It requires the OpenGL library, which is available 
          as the mesa library at \htmladdnormallink{www.mesa3d.org}
          {http://www.mesa3d.org} for any Linux platform, and Qt 5.4 or greater.  For better
          performance, graphics cards from companies such as nVidia 
          \htmladdnormallink{(www.nvidia.com)}
          {http://www.nvidia.com/} usually provide OpenGL libraries.  \\

            \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Requirements} \\ \hline

          \begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
            \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Requirements} \\ \hline

            & Intel processor \\
            & $\ge$ 512 MB main memory \\ \hline
          \end{tabular}
          \end{center}
          
   \item [SGI: ] we have dropped our support for SGI.  This platform, while
     so central to the origins of \map{} and OpenGL, is just not a
     significant desktop system in this day and age.

\subsection{General Installation}

With \map{} moving to Qt for window support, Mac and Windows installers
are available which should just install.  It is still not as easy
as past versions, which required just the download of an executable, but for
now we will attempt to make installation as easy as we can.  Simplified
instructions will be in a README file which comes with each package, and
are also listed below:

To download the software, use this URL
\htmladdnormallink{\texttt{www.sci.utah.edu/software/map3d.html}}
{http://www.sci.utah.edu/software/map3d.html}, and click on the
``Download'' button.  You'll need to sign into the SCI archive.  For
each of the installation instructions below, you can grab those file
from this page.


To test the installation, use the test files that accompany this
distribution.  Each has some script files included that show how to call
and execute \map{}.
