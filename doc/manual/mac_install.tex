\subsection{Mac OS X Installation Instructions}
\label{sec:mac-install}

The Mac OS X installation is relatively straightforward.  You'll need to 
download \map{}'s dependencies, then download \map{} itself.

\subsubsection{Mac OS X Dependencies}

Map3d requires the gtk+2 and gtkglext libraries.  We provide an installer that installs these libraries with the Mac OS X distribution of map3d.  Once you mount the \texttt{map3d-6.5-mac.dmg} disc image there is an installer application called map3d Dependencies.mpkg, just run this program and the libraries will be installed for you.


\subsubsection{Mac OS X Executable}

Also in the \texttt{map3d-6.5-mac.dmg} disc image is a file called \map{}, this is the \map{} executable and to install it, just drag it to a directory of your choice.  We will call that \texttt{RUN-DIR}. This is the directory from which you will run \map{}.
