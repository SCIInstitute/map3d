\subsection{Mac OS X Installation Instructions}
\label{sec:mac-install}

The Mac OS X installation is relatively straightforward.  You'll need to 
download \map{}'s DMG file, and then install it. Inside the DMG is a file
call \map{}. This is the executable and can be run from there.  All the
dependencies are included in the DMG.
