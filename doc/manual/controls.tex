\section{Control of \map{}}
\label{sec:control}

This section describes all the means of controlling the function of \map{},
at least all the ones we are willing to tell you about.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Control by surface}

There is an ever growing number of parameters that the user can alter
for displaying the surfaces in \map{}.  Some of the more important (and
stable) include the following:

\begin{description}
  \item [Visibility:] of points, mesh, potentials, vectors, \etc{} can all
        be controlled individually by using the appropriate function key
        (see Section~\ref{sec:control-keys}), 
      \item [Lead markings: ] of the nodes in the geometry according to
        their node number, channel number, lead number or even value,
  \item [Landmarks: ] appearance of the landmarks on the surface.
\end{description}

Since this level of control is provided for each surface, it is possible to
have points showing on one surface, mesh on another, and rendered potential
shading on a third, and so on. 

\subsubsection{Selecting which surface to control} 
\label{sec:locks} 

To control the display of each surface, be that a surface in its own window
or sharing a single window with other surfaces, a user must select that
surface.  Otherwise, display options will affect all the surfaces.  There
are two different multi-surface situations and each has its own method of
selecting the surface:
%
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|p{3in}|}\hline
    \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Selecting surfaces for display controls} \\ \hline
    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Multi-surface layout} & 
    \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Selection method} \\ \hline
    One surface per window & Mouse location establishes currently active
    window. \\
    Several surfaces in one window & Up/down arrows selects the surface.
    Hitting 
    the up-arrow key after selecting the last surface selects all surface. \\
    \hline 
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Note that in the surface window, the lock icons in the lower left corner
indicate if parameter settings act on all surface (locks visible) or just
single surfaces (locks invisible).  Each lock controls a different aspect of 
\map{}:

\begin{description}
  \item [General Lock:] is represented by the yellow (or first) lock icon.  
        When this lock is active, menu items and keyboard commands pertain 
        to all surfaces.  To turn this lock off and on use the up
        and down arrow keys.
  \item [Transformation Lock: ] is represented by the red (or second) 
        lock icon.  When this lock is active, rotation and translation 
        pertain to all surfaces. To turn this lock on and off, use the
        ``t'' key.
  \item [Frame Lock: ] is represented by the blue (or third) lock icon.
        When this lock is active, frame advancing, retreating, and resetting
        pertain to all surfaces.  To turn this lock on and off, use the
        ``f'' key or select from the menu under \emph{Frame Controls}.
\end{description}

Note: in the case where all surfaces are in the same window, unlocking the
general lock by means of the up or down arrow keys selects the single
surface to display.  However, when the general lock is active and either of
the other locks is disabled, the active surface mesh appears in a different
color (blue by default).  This identifies the selected surface and all
modifications apply to this surface.  To select the desired surface use the
(/) keys; ``('' selects the next surface and ``)'' selects the previous.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Mouse control, keyboard mapping, dials, and menus}
 
Direct interactive control of \map{} is by the keyboard and mouse.
%mouse, and dials.
Many option are available via the menus controlled with the right mouse
button, while others can be activated or toggled with single keystrokes.
Variable (non-binary) adjustments usually occur 
% with the dials, if they are present, 
through dialogues, or by repeating keystrokes.  Below are tables of all the
current control devices and their function.  When the program launches, the
user sets one or more windows which can be resized and moved at any time.
When launching the program with the {\tt -b} option, the resulting
borderless sub-window(s) can still be moved and resized within a main
window using the Alt-key together with the left and middle mouse buttons
respectively.  In Mac OS X and other operating systems where the Alt-key is
mapped to another function you may use the CRTL+SHIFT keys as an
alternative to the Alt-key.


\subsubsection{Mouse control}
\label{sec:control-mouse} 

The mouse can be used for different purposes. Figure~\ref{fig:mouse} 
shows the various actions of the mouse
buttons. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{makeimage}
  \end{makeimage}
  \mouseaction
  \caption{\label{fig:mouse} Mouse action for \map{}. Picking
  makes intensive use of the mouse, as does moving objects in the surface
  window.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{In surface windows: } when the mouse is over a surface window,
mouse buttons have the following actions:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{3in}|} \hline
    \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Mouse Actions}\\ \hline
    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Control Key} & 
    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Button} & 
    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Action}\\ \hline
    None & Left & rotation objects \\
    & Middle & scale objects (downwards increases size, upwards decreases
    size) \\ 
    & Right & activate pull-down menu \\ \hline
    Cntrl & Left & pick a node (and if time series data is present, select the
    channel to display in the time series window) \\
    & Middle &  no action \\
    & Right &  no action \\ \hline
    Shift & Left & translate objects \\
    & Middle & scale objects (rotates clipping planes if they are active
    - more info later) \\ 
    & Right & no action \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\paragraph{In borderless windows: } when the mouse is over a 
surface within a borderless main window (-b option), the buttons have the
following additional actions: 
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{3in}|} \hline
    \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Mouse Actions}\\ \hline
    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Control Key} & 
    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Button} & 
    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Action}\\ \hline
    Alt(Ctrl+Shift)   & Left & Move a single surface subwindow \\ 
      & Middle & Resize single surface subwindow (no indication of change
    until release of mouse button).\\ 
      & Right & no action \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Note: if \map{} does not respond as described in these tables, it may be
that your window manager is grabbing the mouse/key combinations for its own
purpose or maps the keys a little differently.  This will require some
setting changes for the window manager.  In Linux there is usually a
control panel or utility application to manage all window system
interactions.

%\newpage

\subsubsection{Keyboard controls}
\label{sec:control-keys} 

Each key of the regular keyboard, the function keys, and the keypad may be
mapped to some function of the \map{}.  Some keyboard keys serve as toggles
to change between a mode being on or off, \eg{} ``n'' toggles the display
of node markings.  Others cycle through a set of choices, \eg{} ``m'' runs
through a series of display options for the mesh.  Several lists of the
keyboard keys and their functions are shown in
Tables~\ref{table:keys}--\ref{table:keypad}.

\begin{table}[htbp]

        \caption{\label{table:keys} Keyboard controls for Geometry Window

                        filename can be set at start-time with the -if flag 
                        (see Section~\ref{sec:usage-global}), or in the

\subsection{Interactive GUIs - File Selection, File Saving, and Scaling
  Options, \etc{}} 
\label{sec:interactive}

With the move to a dedicated GUI system (in our case, gtk), we make use of
a number of different windows to select parameters and control \map{}.
This section covers the functionality of all of them.

\subsubsection{Files Window}
\label{sec:fileswindow}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{makeimage}
  \end{makeimage}
  \filesdialogone
  \caption{\label{fig:file1} Files Dialog for \map{}.}
\end{figure}

The most frequently used GUI window is the ``\map{} Files'' window, allows
you to interactively select filenames, data windows, etc.  The others are
for saving files, and for quick scaling changes.  Figure~\ref{fig:file1}
shows an example of such a file window, and access to this window is by
means of the ``Files'' menu option of the main menu.  This window displays
one row for each surface, where each row shows the surface number, the
window the surface appears in, the geometry filename, the geometry number,
the data filename, the start frame number, the end frame number, a graph of
the RMS curve, and a button to show other files.  Most of these columns can
be modified at any time.  If you click on the ``New Surface'' button, an
empty row will pop up, allowing you to add a surface from scratch.
 
None of the changes made to this window will take effect until you click on
the ``Apply'' button.  The  ``Close'' button will cause  the window
will close, but opening it again will reveal the same content.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{\label{table:filewindow} Options for the file window}    
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{4in}|} \hline
    \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\textbf{File Window Options}} \\ \hline\hline
    Surf      &      Number of the surface \\ \hline
    Win\#      &      Number of the window that contains this surface.
          You can change this number to move the surface to any
          open window, or to a new window (by selecting the last
          number from the drop-down menu). \\ \hline
    Geom File &      Name of the geometry file of this surface.  To change
        the geom file click on the
        ... button and then browsing for the desired file. You may reload the
        current geometry by  
        selecting the ``Mesh$\Rightarrow$Reload Geometry'' 
        menu entry. \\ \hline
    Geom\#     &      Number of surface within the geometry file (see
         Section~\ref{sec:geomfiles}). 
         If there is more than one surface in the geometry
         file, an associated drop-down  menu selects which one to 
         insert.   \\ \hline
    Geom Save (disk icon) &      Allows saving of the current geometry ( see
         Section~\ref{sec:savegeom}). \\ \hline
    Data File      &   Name of the data file of this surface.
         As with geometry  clicking on the ... button launches 
         a file browser to select a time-series data file.
         Selecting the ``Mesh$\Rightarrow$Reload Data'' reloads
         the data. \\ \hline
    Data Selection &   If more than one time series is present in the data
         file, the selection will allow you to choose between them \\ \hline
    Start Frame           &   Start reading data at this frame. 
         Left-clicking 
         in the graph section and dragging will also  select the
         correct frame. \\ \hline
    End Frame             &       Finish reading data at this frame.
         Middle-clicking in the graph section and dragging 
         will  select the correct frame. \\ \hline 
    Frame Step            &       If larger than 1, \map{} will load every nth frame \\ \hline 
    Graph     &       Graph of the root-mean-square signal calculated
         from all signals in the time series.    Left- or
         middle-clicking in this graph selects the data window that
         \map{} will read and display. \\ \hline 
    Other Files (+)       &       This button will expand another section
         in which to view/modify the channels, leadlinks, 
         landmarks, or fiducial file to use with this surface. \\ \hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}


\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{makeimage}
  \end{makeimage}
  \filesdialogthree
  \caption{\label{fig:file3} Empty Files Dialog. \map{} will start up this way
            if launched without arguments.}
\end{figure}

Note that the File window allows launching of \map{} without any arguments.
In this case an empty file window appears, as in Figure~\ref{fig:file3} so
that the user can select all the files for display and set up the display
interactively.

\paragraph{Saving Geometry}
\label{sec:savegeom}


When selecting the save icon, a menu will pop up prompting whether \map{}
should save the file with the current transformations or not.
If "Apply transformations" is chosen, then \map{} will save the geometry with the
current transformations (translations and rotations) applied.
Make sure to modify the filename or the current filename will be replaced.  
Files can be named with .mat, .fac, or .pts extensions. If the filename ends
in the extension .fac, it will save filename.fac and filename.pts.
%If Transforms is selected and
%there is a landmarks file, then a filename.lmark.

\subsubsection{Saving Images/Animations}
\label{sec:saving}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{makeimage}
  \end{makeimage}
  \savedialog
  \caption{\label{fig:save1} Image Control Dialog.}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Saving Images}
\label{sec:saveimages}

The Image Control dialog is used to control the base filename for saved images
and whether to save animations.  Select a filename (you can click on ... to browse for
a filename) and click save. The filename may have the extension .ppm, ,png,
or .jpg to save in one of those formats.  The final filename also appends a
4-digit number before the extension, representing a number in a sequence of
images.  I.e., if the filename selected is map3d.png, the image will
actually save in map3d0000.png, and subsequent images will be
map3d0001.png, map3d0002.png, etc.  The image that will saved is
approximately the smallest rectangle that contains all open map3d windows.

NOTE: If there are windows that overlap, the one on top might not be the one
\map{} thinks is on top.  So if after moving windows around, it is
necessary to click inside the
window (not the title bar), to tell \map{} it is on the top.  Otherwise,
data that appears on the computer screen may end up obscured by other
windows that appear to lie beneath. 

If the Save... window is in the way, close it, and pressing the 'w'
key will have the same effect as clicking the ``Save Image'' button. 

\paragraph{Saving Animations}
\label{sec:saveanimations}

Checking the "Automatically save image when changes occur" box
allows you to control automatic frame saving to put images 
together into movies.  While \map{} is not yet sophisticated enough to 
actually create the movies, this control can save the images you need and
then you can use some external software to make a movie from them.
See Section~\ref{sec:animation} for links to instructions of how to make 
movies from sets of images. 

\medskip
There are three changes types that determine whether an image will be saved.  
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Save Frame on Transformation - will save a frame (image) every
        time you transform (rotate, translate, scale) any surface, either 
        with the mouse or the keyboard.
  \item Save Frame on Frame Advance - will save a frame when you move 
        forward or backward in time with the arrow key, or change the time
        in the pick window.
  \item Save Frame on Other Events - will save a frame when you interact with
        with the Geometry Window in any other way, via keyboard commands or 
        menu controls.

\subsection{Controlling the time signal window}
\label{sec:control-scalar} 


There are two ways to create a time signal window:
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Specify a \texttt{-at xmin xmin ymin ymax} on the command line
        (optionally with a \texttt{-t trace-lead-number} to specify the
        channel to use).
      \item Using picking (Cntrl-left mouse) to select a lead to show in
        the time signal window, when the current pick mode is time signal
        new-window mode or time signal refresh mode.  Note that subsequent
        time signal picking can be set to either a) update the last time
        signal window to the new data channel or b) add yet another time
        signal window.
\end{enumerate}
%

The format of the scalar display is fairly simple 
%(see Section~\ref{sec:displayscalar})
, with a vertical bar moving along the time axis as the frame number is
advanced.  \map{} derives the time axis label from the frame numbers of the
signal relative to the time series data file, not relative to the subset of
frame read in, \ie{} if frames (or pot file numbers) 10--20 are read in
with an increment of 2, then frame number will begin at 10, and go through
12, 14, 16, 18 and end at 20 rather then beginning at 0 or 1 and going to 10
(the number of frames of data actually read).

%There is also a menu item for adjusting the time base of the signal,
%manually aligning time across multiple windows, and setting the time
%increment between frames of data.

\subsubsection{Adjusting the frame selector}
\label{sec:control-frames} 

In order to facilitate rapid movement through large datasets, the user can
control the frame number being displayed by interacting with the scalar
window itself.  If the user moves the cursor to the scalar window and
pushes the left mouse button, the vertical time bar will jump to the
nearest sample to the cursor location.  The user can then hold the left
button down and slide the time marker left and right and set a desired
frame.  Once the mouse button is released,\map{} updates the map display.
The left and right arrow keys also shift the frame marker back and forth.
The only other command allowed when the cursor is within the scalar window
is the ``q''-key, to shut down just the scalar window, the ``f'' key,
to toggle the frame lock, or the ``p'' key, to toggle the display mode.
Any other attempt at input will not be accepted.

\subsection{Color/Size Selection}
\label{sec:control-color} 

It is frequently necessary to control color and size of elements of the
\map{} display and this, we have selection subwindows that appear as
necessary and disappear upon selection.


\subsubsection{Color Picker}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{makeimage}
  \end{makeimage}
  \colorpicker
  \caption{\label{fig:colorpicker1} Color Picker.}
\end{figure}


The Color Picker shows a number of colors to select from.  There are only a
limited number of colors so that the color selection can be easily
reproduced on subsequent runs.  When you open up the Color Picker, the
current (original) color will be in a small box on the bottom left, whereas
the box next to it will show the color that was most recently selected.
There is a new ``Preview'' button which will change the color and let you
see what it would do, but will also allow you to push the ``Cancel'' button
and return to the original color, shown in the bottom left.

\subsubsection{Size Picker}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{makeimage}
  \end{makeimage}
  \sizepicker
  \caption{\label{fig:sizepicker1} Size Picker.}
\end{figure}


The Size Picker shows 10 sizes to select from, currently (to change later)
represented by the size of boxes, where the width of the box represents the
selectable size.  When you open up the Size Picker, the current (original)
size will be represented in a box on the bottom left, whereas the box next
to it will show the size that was most recently selected.  There is a new
``Preview'' button which will change the size and let you see what it would
do, but will also allow you to push the ``Cancel'' button and return to the
original size, shown in the bottom left.

\subsubsection{Interactive Size Control}
\label{sec:interactive-size}

Rather than having to open the Size Picker over and over, \map{} provides a
few options that can be changed by a single keystroke.  To do this, open
the menu in the Geometry Window and select ``Mesh->Use +/- to select'' and
then select a feature you wish to dynamically adjust.  Then press + or - to
adjust the size.  However, most of these only have 10 possible sizes.



\subsubsection{Scaling Options}
\label{sec:scalinggui}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{makeimage}
  \end{makeimage}
  \scaledialog
  \caption{\label{fig:scale1} The three tabs of the Scaling Dialog.}
\end{figure}

This three-tabbed dialog contains the same options as the Scaling Menu in
the Geometry menu, but in dialog form for convenience.  Click on the tab at
the top of the scaling type you wish to change (Range, Function, or
Mapping), and click on the check box of the feature you wish to select, and
\map{} will update.  (see Section~\ref{sec:control-menus}, scaling menu)
and Section~\ref{sec:scaling}.

\subsubsection{Contour Setting Dialog}
\label{sec:contourwindow}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{makeimage}
  \end{makeimage}
  \contourdialog
  \caption{\label{fig:contourdialog} Contour Spacing Dialog.}
\end{figure}

The contour setting dialog allows selection of the contour spacing, number
of contours and scaling range.  A side-effect of this dialog is that a
change of one feature has consequences on other features.  For example,
changing the number of contours will likely also change the spacing between
the contours.  Alternatively, it could change the range of the scaling,
\ie{} the maximum and minimum used to map value to color.  This
interdependence of the control parameters can make this dialog somewhat
obscure but it does allow broad flexibility of settings.

There are two controls that affect the interplay among features - when the range
changes, adjust either: Contour Spacing or Num Contours.
The choice between these two will determine which
parameter will remain constant when the range changes (the range can change
by selecting a different contour or by setting the range explicitly).

A second, related control is the ``Fixed Range'' check box on each row.
If it is checked, then changing the contour spacing will affect the number
of contours and vice-versa.  If it is checked, then changing the number
of contours or the spacing will affect the range, and changing the range
will affect either the number of contours or the contour spacing.  Also,
unselecting ``Fixed Range'' will set the scaling range for this surface
to the range specified in the contour dialog and will not reflect the
default range parameter.

The occlusion gradient is used to ignore data on triangles whose gradient
exceeds the number specified.  This is useful if there would be too many
contours present.  The default number is the total range of the entire dataset,
in effect disabling the feature.

Upon pressing ``Apply'', the changes will take effect.  Note that
the exact contour spacing will only take effect if the scaling function is 
set to Linear and the mapping is set to True.  Otherwise, an approximate 
contour spacing will result. 

This description may sound confusing but some trial and error should
hopefully provide complete control over the display of scaling features.
Complexity is the cost of flexibility and when in doubt, we have always
tended toward flexibility. 



\subsubsection{Fiducial Control}
\label{sec:fiducialswindow}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{makeimage}
  \end{makeimage}
  \fiducialswindow
  \caption{\label{fig:fid1} The Fiducials Control Windows.}
\end{figure}

Fiducials are time markers in the signals, for
example, indicating the time of activation or the start and end of the QRS
complex in an ECG.  Because the main application domain of \map{} is
cardiac electrophysiology, the selection of support fiducials is related to
signals from the heart.  However, there is not reason one could not add new
fiducials (contact \rob{}) 

There are two ways of viewing fiducials.
%
\begin{description}
  \item [1) Single fiducial contour: ] in this mode, \map{} draws an
    isochrone line over top of the potential map that corresponds to the
    time value of the current potential map.  This sounds complicated but
    it means that, for example, if the potential map has a time value
    within the range of activation times for the time series, then
    somewhere on the map will be an isochrone corresponding to that
    activation time.  In practice, one sees the activation contour 
    expand with each step in time and can also perform quality control of
    any fiducial detection algorithm
    
    The lower window in Figure~\ref{fig:fid1} allows control of the display
    of the contour, setting the contour thickness and the color associated
    with each time of fiducial.
    
  \item [2) Multiple fiducial contours or maps:] This is the more
    traditional model of fiducial map display in which the entire set of
    isochrone values maps up a map.  To enable simultaneous viewing of
    potential and fiducials in this mode, \map{} provides a number of
    options controlled by
    the ``p''-key, and the ``s''-key, and the other options in the Fiducials menu.  With various
    combinations, it is possible to display a) potentials as shaded maps
    with black isochrones, b) no potentials with colored isochrones, and c)
    potentials as black contours drawn over shaded color isochrone map.
    The window allows selection of the particular fiducial to display.
\end{description}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{makeimage}
  \end{makeimage}
  \fidexamples
  \caption{\label{fig:fidexamples} Examples of fiducial displays.  Panels
    A, and B show different forms of activation contour display over shaded
    potential maps.  Panels C and D show displays of shaded activation maps
    with superimposed potentials (Panel C) and a single activation contour
    (Panel D).  Panel E shows a contour display of activation time. }
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:fidexamples} shows different forms of display of activation
times using the fiducial display options.  The choice of which is most
informative depends on the perspective of the user and the problem at hand.
The images in Panel A and D are useful to perform a quick quality control
of that fiducial map.  Panel B supports a more detailed analysis by
allowing the user to step through time and see fiducial contours associated
with each time value superimposed on the potentials.  In this way, the user
can use spatial information to evaluate the quality of the fiducial values.
For a more temporal vie	w, the user can click on any number of time signals
(see Figure~\ref{fig:scalar}) and see the fiducial markers superimposed as
vertical lines that are color coded according to fiducial type.


\subsection{Picking mode}
\label{sec:control-picking} 

By ``picking'' we mean selecting some piece of the display in the current
window using the mouse.  \map{} currently supports selection of nodes or
triangles with different actions, all of which either return some
information, affect the display, or even alter the geometry of the display.
The current choices include node information, triangle information, time
signal displays, triangulation, triangle deletion, triangle flipping, node
editing/deletion, landmark editing.  Note that picking is successful and
the desired results occur only when there is one (no more, no less) hit.
To aid in getting the one hit, you may adjust the picking aperture or
activate the clipping planes.  In any picking mode where your geometry is
modified, you might want to save your geometry (see
Section~\ref{sec:saving}).  To control picking, use the top-level
``Picking'' menu. See Tables~\ref{table:pickingone} and
\ref{table:pickingtwo} for the available options.


% and then one of the choices in the
% ``Toggle Pick Action'' submenu. Below we describe each of the picking
% option in more detail.

%  To adjust the size of the picking window, the keypad plus/minus keys can be
%  used, much as they are to alter the sensitivity of the dials to rotation
%  and translation.  Experience suggests that a larger window makes
%  triangulating (selecting nodes) easier while a small window makes selecting
%  triangles (to remove or flip them).  Each picking mode maintains its own
%  picking window size so that changes affect only the current picking mode.

\begin{description}
  \item[Time Signal (new window mode): ] This mode opens up a new window
    and provides information about the node/channel.  It tells the node
    number, channel number, the associated surface, the current frame
    number, and the value of the scalar data at the current time instance.
    In addition, it shows a graph of the scalar data associated with that
    node over time.
    
  \item[Time Signal (refresh window mode): ] This mode provides the same
    information and graph as the new window mode, but displays the
    information in the most-recently created window (and creates one if one
    doesn't exist).
    
  \item[Node Information: ] This mode outputs information of the selected
    node to the console: Surface number, frame number, node number, channel
    number, current data value, and the X,Y,Z coordinates of the point (as
    read by the geometry file).
    
  \item[Triangle Information: ] This mode outputs information of the
    selected triangle to the console: Surface number, triangle number, and
    the numbers and X,Y,Z coordinates of the 3 triangle points (as read by
    the geometry file).

  \item[Triangle Construction (Triangulating) and Deletion: ]
    \label{sec:triangulate} 
    In this mode, the left mouse is used to select the nodes that you wish
    connected into a triangle.  Note that each time you select a valid
    point a change is made to the geometry.  The first valid point you will
    see a new point on the mesh.  The second will be similar except there
    will be a line connecting the two points, and the third time will add
    the completed triangle to the geometry
%(see figure~\ref{fig:triangulate}).

    Pushing CTRL-middle mouse button selects a triangle and kills it,
    removing it from the list.

%  Files with the latest version of the connectivity are updated each time you
%  leave triangulate mode, which you can do by either hitting the ``Q'' key or
%  selecting ``Turn picking off'' option.  The filenames are created in a
%  random fashion and are (optional) removed when you end the session and
%  save the latest version of the geometry in a file of you choice.  When you
%  go to exit \map{}, you will be asked for the basefilename into which you
%  wish the updated version of all surfaces (points and connectivities) to be
%  stored.  At the moment, these files are .pts/.fac files, which can easily
%  be converted to .geom files if needed.  
    
  \item[Triangle flipping: ] Often it is necessary to know the orientation
    of the triangles in the geometry.  While this can be computed, there
    remains a 180-degree ambiguity as to which way the normal points.  To
    resolve this, triangles nodes should be ordered in a counterclockwise
    direction as viewed from the ``outside'' of the surface to which the
    triangle belongs.  This convention is used by OpenGL to decide which
    triangles to show in ``hide back-facing triangles'' mode.
    Unfortunately, it is not always possible when constructing geometric
    models to tell which way the triangle is to be viewed---this is still
    something humans do better than computers---and so we often need to
    edit a geometric model so that the triangles are 'flipped' the right
    way.  Hence, the ``Flip triangle'' option in the ``Picking'' menu.
    
  \item[Edit node: ] If your surface isn't perfect, you can edit the
    positions of the nodes.  Select this pick mode in the Picking menu, and
    pick a node.  A mark will appear on the node that you pick.  Then use
    the keyboard transformation controls to translate a node (see
    Section~\ref{sec:control-keys}, keypad controls).  Note that keyboard
    rotation won't work in this mode.
    
  \item[Edit landmark point: ] If your landmarks aren't perfect, you can
    edit their positions.  Select this pick mode in the Picking menu, and
    pick a landmark point.  A mark will appear on the point that you pick.
    Then use the keyboard transformation controls to translate it (see
    Section~\ref{sec:control-keys}, keypad controls).  Note that keyboard
    rotation won't work in this mode.
    
  \item[Delete node: ] In this mode, any node you pick and any triangle
    that connects with it will be removed from the geometry.
    
  \item[Reference lead, single value: ] In this mode, the value of the node
    you pick will be used as the reference from which the other nodes will
    be measured.
    
  \item[Reference lead, mean value: ] In this mode, a mean value of all the
    nodes will be used as the reference from which the nodes will be
    measured.

There are some lighting and colour controls for the display of landmarks
that are useful to know about.  Table~\ref{table:landmarks} describes all
the specific menus mentioned here.

\begin{description}
  \item [Coronary/Catheter: ] these are controls to adjust color and
        visibility of the vessel type landmark, the ones we use for
        arteries and also for catheters.  You can also switch from a
        rendered version of this landmark type to a wire mesh that is
        labeled according to segment numbers---a debugging tool when the
        vessels are not going where you expect.
  \item [Points: ] there are a range of point types in the landmark suite
        and this option allows you to control them turn them off and on,
        adjust color, etc.
  \item [Planes: ] for the plane landmark, you can set color, but also the
        transparency level of the plane.  Default is transparent and this
        usually works best.
  \item [Rods: ] as with points, there are different rod type landmarks and
        with this menu you can control their visibility and color.
  \item [Toggle all landmarks: ] this is the master switch and toggling it
        turns all the landmarks from on to off or vice versa.
