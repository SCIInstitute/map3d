\section{Usage} 
\label{sec:usage}

This version of \map{} provides two ways to load files.  The first is 
via the command line, which is described in this section.  The second is
via the files window (see Section~\ref{sec:fileswindow}).  You can also
launch \map{} with some command line options and then modify the associated
settings using interactive menus and the files window.  

This is a subset of \map{}'s usage:
\begin{verbatim} 
  map3d  -b -nw -nv
         -f geomfilename 
           -w
           -as xmin xmax ymin ymax 
           -al xmin xmax ymin ymax
           -at xmin xmax ymin ymax 
           -t time-signal-number 
           -c mesh colour
           -p scalar data (potentials) filename 
             -s num1 num2 
             -i increment 
             -ph maxpotval 
             -pl minpotval 
             -cs contour-spacing 
             -ps scaling_value 
             -ch channels-filename 
             -sl surfnum
             -ff fidfile
           -lm landmarks-filename
           -ll leadlinks-filename
           -lh 
\end{verbatim}

\map{} also has other parameters it accepts that are designed for the use
of a .map3drc or script file, and those parameters will be shown in
table~\ref{table:settingsoptions}.

\subsection{Typical usage examples}
\label{sec:usage-examples} 

\noindent
Here are some typical examples of using \map{}:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item Display the contents of a geometry file:
  \begin{verbatim}
      map3d
      map3d -f geomfilename.pts
      map3d -f geomfilename.fac
      map3d -f geomfilename.geom

  \end{verbatim}
  \vspace{-.2in}
  The first instance will run map3d and allow you to input files interactively
  (see Section~\ref{sec:fileswindow}).
  
  The first form with arguments reads only the node points (.pts file
  extension) while the second form also reads the connectivities from a
  .fac file and displays both mesh and nodes.  The third form assumes that
  a binary geometry file (.geom extension) exists that contains both nodes
  and connectivities.  We describe all these forms of geometry files in
  Section~\ref{sec:geomfile}.
  
  \item Map scalar values from a single time instant stored in a ``pot''
  file (described in Section~\ref{sec:potfiles}):
  \begin{verbatim}
      map3d -f geomfilename.fac -p datafilename.pot
  \end{verbatim}

  \item When there is a mapping required between the potentials and the 
  geometry, \eg{} when the order of values in the .pot and .pts file 
  are not identical, we require a channels file (see 
  Section~\ref{sec:leadfiles} for details of the channels files),
  \begin{verbatim}
      map3d -f geomfilename.fac -p datafilename.pot -ch thefile.channels
  \end{verbatim}
   
  \item To display a \emph{time series} of scalar values on the geometry, 
  the basic format is the same
  \begin{verbatim}
      map3d -f geomfilename.fac -p datafilename.tsdf
  \end{verbatim}
  \vspace{-.2in}
  with the time series stored in a datafile described in
  Section~\ref{sec:tsdffile}.

  \item Geometry can also be stored in a binary file in the CVRTI 
  format (described in Section~\ref{sec:geomfile}).  The command 
  format is essentially unchanged
  \begin{verbatim}
      map3d -f geomfilename.geom -p datafilename.tsdf
  \end{verbatim}
  \vspace{-.2in}
  except that channel information is usually contained in the .geom 
  file and thus seldom needs to be specified explicitly.
  
  \item A time series data file (.tsdf) contains a sequence of 
  potentials, as described in Section~\ref{sec:tsdffile}.
  To select a subset of the time series for display, append the 
  parameters \texttt{-s} and, optionally,  \texttt{-i}, for example,
  \begin{verbatim}
      map3d -f geomfilename.fac -p datafilename.tsdf -s 1 100 -i 2
  \end{verbatim}
  \vspace{-.2in}
  to select time instants 1 to 100 with an increment between instants 
  of 2 (\ie{} 1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots, 99).  

  \item Another way to describe a time series is through a series of .pot
  files that are numbered in sequence.  For example to read a sequence of
  the files \texttt{mapdata001.pot}, \texttt{mapdata002.pot},
  \texttt{mapdata003.pot}, \ldots{}  \texttt{mapdata009.pot}
  \begin{verbatim}
      map3d -f geomfilename.fac -p mapdata -s 1 9 
  \end{verbatim}
  
  \item Geometry files can contain more than one geometry 
  so that we need to select a specific collection of nodes and 
  connectivities for the display, by means of an ``@'' suffix to the 
  geometry filename specification.  Calling 
  \begin{verbatim}
      map3d -f geomfilename.geom@2 -p datafilename.tsdf
  \end{verbatim}
  \vspace{-.2in}
  will select geometry \#2 from the file \texttt{geomfilename.geom}.

  \item Multiple instances of \texttt{-f} create multiple surfaces, which by
  default all appear in the same  window.  Adding the \texttt{-nw} option
  creates a separate window for each of the surfaces.  So a typical call
  would look like
  \begin{verbatim}
      map3d -f geomfile1.fac -p thedata1 -f geomfile2.fac -p thedata2 
  \end{verbatim}
  However, you can include all the regular features for each of the
  surfaces so that things can get much more complex.  For multi-surface
  displays, it is often better to use script files (see
  Section~\ref{sec:scripts}) below.

\end{itemize}

This version of \map{} provides an interactive means of 
specifying geometry numbers from a .geom file or time instants from a 
time series data file (see Section~\ref{sec:fileswindow}).

\subsection{Global Parameters}
\label{sec:usage-global} 

\noindent
The following general parameters affect the entire display:
\begin{description}
    
  \item[{\tt -b }] = open each individual window without borders
    placed within a master window that still has the usual borders.  To
    move or resize individual windows, hold the Alt (meta) key and use the left
    and middle mouse buttons, respectively.  Most of these can be anywhere on
    the command line.  Also, if you use {\tt -b} without any other arguments,
    \map{} will allow you to select the files interactively and add them to
    this master window.
    
    
  \item [{\tt -v}] = show current version of the program.  If this is
    the only argument, the program will exit.
    
%  \item[{\tt -vm}] = run program in video mode. This thickens lines,
%        and sets a reduced range of colours, for the purpose of making
%        videos from graphics output. 
%        This also initializes the video equipment in VISSGI\@. 
        
  \item[{\tt -nw}] = for multiple surfaces ({\em i.e.,} more than one
    set of points and triangles), place each surface data in a new
    window. By default, \map{} opens a single window for all
    surfaces.
    
  \item[{\tt -slw 0}] = do not show any legend windows at startup.

  \item[{\tt -fs interval}] = Sets the run-time interval between frames
    as accessed by the arrow keys.  Note that this is independent of the 
    {\tt -i} option below, which subsamples the data as it is being read in.
    This feature can be changed via the menus at runtime.
    
  \item[{\tt -nv}] = to NOT check validity of geometry files.  This can
    have a large impact on startup performance if \map{} needs to
    load large geometries.
    
  \item [{\tt -c colour}] = colour value to use on all
    surfaces for which there is no specific colour specification.  
    This option must be set before any surfaces are read, since the 
    same option sets the colors for individual surfaces.  See the 
    mesh-specific {\tt -c colour} below for colour examples. 
    
  \item [{\tt -bg colour}] = colour value to use as background of all
    windows for which there is no specific colour specification.  
    This option must be set before any surfaces are read, since the 
    same option sets the colors for individual windows.
    
  \item [{\tt -fg colour}] = colour value to use as text colour for all
    windows for which there is no specific colour specification.  
    This option must be set before any surfaces are read, since the 
    same option sets the colors for individual windows.
    
%  \item [{\tt -df filename}] = read the defaults file {\tt filename} for
%        start-up settings for the program.  This overrides any defaults
%        files read by the program (see below) or any defaults set within
%        the program. 

  \item [{\tt -if basefilename}] = base filename for any image files that
        are generated in this run of the program.

  \item[{\tt -dp datafile\_pathname}] = directs the search for data files
        accessed to another directory.  Using an alternate pathname, 
        you can override the
        original directory specification for the files and get them from,
        say, an optical disk.  This value can also be set with an
        environmental variable called {\tt MAP3D\_DATAPATH}, which you can
        set at any time before executing \map{}.  With this option, \map{}
        looks in {\tt datapath/filename}.

%        This value can also be specified in the
%        defaults file (see section~\ref{sec:defaults}) 

%  \item[{\tt -gp geomfile\_pathname}] = directs the search for geometry files
%        accessed via a .tsdf file to another directory.  The most common
%        case of this is when the name of the geometry file is stored in the
%        data file, usually without directory specification. This value can
%        also be specified in the
%        defaults file (see section~\ref{sec:defaults}) or via an
%        environmental variable called {\tt MAP3D\_GEOMPATH}, which you can
%        set at any time before executing \map{}.  You may specify this
%        option either globally for all surfaces by inserting is before the
%        first {\tt -f filename} in the command line, or separately for each
%        surface. 

%  \item [{\tt -rl report\_level}] = set the report level for this execution
%        of \map{}.  The legal values are 0 (no reporting) to 4 (full
%        debug-level reporting).  
%       This values overrides the one set in the
%        default file, bit should be specified after the default file if the
%        {\tt -df} option is used.

%  \item [{\tt -vw xmin ymin}] = Set the lower left hand corner of the video
%        window to a particular spot on the screen.  Units are in screen
%        coordinates, same as for the {\tt -as} and {\tt -ts} commands
%        described below.

\end{description}
        
\subsection{Geometry specifications}
\label{sec:usage-geometry} 


The basis for display in \map{} is one or more geometry descriptions,
which are usually in the form of surfaces, but can also be a set of line
segments or tetrahedra; hence we can picture each set of nodes and
connectivities as a ``meta-surface'', which we generally refer to as a
``surface''.  For each such surface, \map{} needs the set of node locations
in three-dimensional space and usually some connectivity information that
defines the (meta) surface.  The geometries must exist in discrete form and
be stored in files that \map{} can read (see Section~\ref{sec:geomfile} for
details of the file formats).  There is no provision at present for
analytically defined geometries.

To tell \map{} where to look for this geometry information, 
each occurrence of \texttt{-f} in the command line indicates that 
beginning of a new surface.  All parameters (except for global options)
that follow before the 
next occurrence of \texttt{-f} refer to the current surface.
%
\begin{description}
  \item[{\tt -f geometry-file} ]
                                %  or {\tt datafile.tsdf}]
    = filename of the geometry file(s) containing points and
    connectivity information.   Legal formats for the file specification 
    are: 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item nodes (.pts) file will read and display only the 
        nodes from the geometry; no display of the potentials is 
        possible with just this information;
        
      \item triangles/tetrahedra (.fac/.tetra) file will read 
        \textbf{both} the connectivities and the nodes (provided
        both exist and share the same root filename);
        
      \item binary geometry (.geom) file contains both nodes and 
        connectivity information and may also contain channel
        mapping.  At present, multi-surface geometry files must
        include a specific indication of the desired surface
        (\texttt{@surfnum}); otherwise, \map{} reads all surfaces
        in the file.  
      \item binary matlab geometry (.mat) file contains both nodes and 
        connectivity information and may also contain channel
        mapping.  If there are multiple surfaces in the matlab
        file, the same restrictions apply as in the .geom files.
    \end{enumerate}
    Note: by specifying a root filename without any extension, \map{} will
    look for all valid geometry files and try and construct the most
    comprehensive set.  (It will do the same for data files as well.)
    Where there are multiple, potentially
    conflicting files with the same root, \eg{} \texttt{file.pts} and
    \texttt{file.geom}, \map{} will select binary over text files.  
    See Section \ref{sec:readgeom} for more details on the rules for
    specifying and reading geometry files.  
    
  \item[{\tt-w}] = place this and subsequent surfaces in a new window.
    This option will do nothing if the \texttt{-nw} option is set or if
    this is the first surface
    
  %    \item[{\tt -ac}] = do not shift the origin of the points to the centroid
  %    of the pointset but leave values as they are in the input geometry
  %    files. 
    
  \item[{\tt-fg colour}]
    = desired colour for the screen information of a particular 
    window, if this will be   
    specified as a red, green, and blue value triplet ranging from 
    0 to 255.  Some examples are:\\
                                % 
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
            255 0 0     & red \\
            0 255 0     & green\\
            0 0 255     & blue\\
            255 255 0   & yellow\\
            255 0 255   & magenta  \\
            0 255 255   & cyan \\
            255 255 255 & white  \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    
  \item[{\tt-bg colour}]
    = desired colour for the background of a particular window,
    specified as a red, green, and blue value triplet.  
    See the {\tt-fg option} for examples.
    
  \item[{\tt-c colour}]
    = desired colour for the mesh of a particular surface,
    specified as a red, green, and blue value triplet.  
    See the {\tt-fg option} for examples.
    
    
  \item[{\tt-as xmin xmax ymin ymax}] = set the absolute location in
    pixels of the surface window most recently defined.  We
    assume an origin in the lower left corner of the screen and
    the typical full screen of an SGI workstation with a 19-inch
    monitor has 1280 by 1024 pixels.  This option is useful for
    setting consistent layout of windows, especially when
    there are multiple surfaces, each in its own window.
    
  \item[{\tt-al xmin xmax ymin ymax}] = set the absolute location in 
    pixels of the surface window most recently defined's colormap
    legend window.  There will be one of these windows per
    surface only if a valid data file is associated with it.
    
  \item[{\tt -slw 0}] = do not show the legend window for this surface.

  \item[{\tt -lh }] = Set the most recently defined surface's colormap
        legend window to have a horizontal instead of vertical layout.

  \item[{\tt -lm landmark\_filename }] = read from the file {\tt
      landmark\_filename} a set of coronary arteries, or any other
    landmark information stored as a series of points, with a radius
    associated with each.  See section~\ref{sec:lmfile} below for
    details.
    
  \item[{\tt -ll leadlinks-filename}] = file in {\em
      leadlinks\/} format containing a list of the node locations
    that correspond to a subset of the leads, \eg{} the lead
    locations on the torso surface that correspond to the standard
    ECG leads.  The point of identifying such leads is to display
    them with their own markings, either as spheres or with the
    lead number (typically not the same as the node number).  For
    more information, 
%        see the {\tt l} key-command in
%       Section~\ref{sec:control-keys}, which toggles the display of the
%       leads in the leadlink file and 
    see the menu options in
    Section~\ref{sec:control-menus} that determine the form of the display
    markings and Section \ref{sec:leadfiles} for more information on 
    leadlinks files.
    
%  \item[{\tt-cg colour}] = desired colour for the vectors in any grad
%        files read for this surface.  This is meaningful when the
%        amplitudes of the vectors have no intrinsic meaning (\eg{}
%        fiber-orientation vectors). \\ 
%        %      
%       \begin{tabular}{ll}
%          1 = red    & 4 = cyan\\
%          2 = green  & 5 = magenta  \\
%          3 = blue   & 6 = yellow \\
%          7 = white  &
%       \end{tabular}

%  \item[{\tt -ds }] = make this surface the dominant surface in a
%        master/slave relationship used in the program for moving surfaces
%        independently of one another.

%  \item[{\tt -dp datafile\_pathname}] = same as above but for this surface
%        only. 

%  \item[{\tt -gp geomfile\_pathname}] = same as above but for this surface
%        only. 


\end{description}

\subsection{Scalar Data parameters}
\label{sec:scalarparams} 

To display scalar data values on the geometry, we must specify the source 
of the data and how to link them to the geometry.  As with the 
geometry, all arguments specified between two occurrences of \texttt{-f} 
in the command line refer to the currently valid surface.  Within pairs of
\texttt{-f} options, there can be only a single instance of any of the
following options:
%
\begin{description}
    
  \item[{\tt-p potfilename}] = filename for the potential and
    current data files.  The legal file types for scalar data are:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Pot files (.pot) (see Section~\ref{sec:potfiles} are 
        text-based files which contain one file per time instance.
        
      \item Time-series data files (.tsdf) are binary files where all
        time instants are stored in one file. 
        
      \item matlab files (.mat) are also stored in binary format.  
        Matlab files can also contain multiple time series. 
        
      \item Time-series container files (.tsdfc), contain references
        to at least one .tsdf file, along with other information
        about the time series.  See Section~\ref{sec:tsdfcfile}
        for more information.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    The \texttt{-s} option determines how many frames to load. 
    In the case of pot files, this controls which pot files to open 
    (If \texttt{-s} is omitted, it will only open the pot file specified). 
    For binary files, the \texttt{-s} option specifies the start
    and end frame numbers to be read from the file.  With no
    \texttt{-s} option, \map{} will read in all time instants from
    the file.  Note also that if you omit the extension, as with
    geometry files, it will try to match a .pot, .tsdf, .mat, or .tsdfc
    extension for you. \\

    For files with multiple time series (matlab or tsdf containers),
    you may specify the time series by the command line with the ``@'' 
    suffix appended to the filename followed by the time series index 
    within the file. \\

    {\em eg.,} \hspace{.2in}{\tt -p file.mat@1} reads the first time
    series and 
    {\em eg.,} \hspace{.2in}{\tt -p file.tsdfc@2} reads the second time
    series.
    
  \item[{\tt -s num1 num2}] = range of frame numbers to read.  If we are
    reading data from .pot or .grad files, \map{} appends each of the
    numbers between \texttt{num1} and \texttt{num2} 
    to the value of {\tt potfilename} to make complete pot filenames.
    However, you must run \map{} with the full pot filename (one of the 
    pot files in the series). \\ 
    {\em eg.,} \hspace{.2in}{\tt -p good-map001.pot -s 1 3}\hspace{.2in}
    expands to:\\
    \mbox{\hspace{1in}}
    {\tt good-map001.pot good-map002.pot good-map003.pot}\\
    If we are reading from a time series (.tsdf) data file, \map{} will
    read frames {\tt num1} to {\tt num2} from the file.
    
  \item[{\tt-i increment}] = difference between each frame number.
    With the last few versions, this would still read in all the frames, but
    this version acts more like the versions prior to that, and subsamples
    the data.  
    
  \item[{\tt-ph maxpotval}] = maximum data value in ``user'' scaling
    mode.  This sets one option for setting the range used in 
    scaling the data value to colours and contours.  You can select other
    ranges from the menu and can select this one again with
    Scaling->Range->Command-line specified range. 
    
  \item[{\tt-pl minpotval}]
    = minimum data value in ``user'' scaling mode. 
    
  \item[{\tt-cs contour-spacing}] = spacing between contours set by the
    user.  This provides a menu option for selecting contours by setting a
    constant spacing rather than deriving the spacing from the desired
    number of contours and the range of data values.  Note that the spacing
    will not always be a the command-line set value - \map{} will divide
    the range by the specified value and set the number of contours as that
    number, and then determine the contour values by using that number of
    contours with the currently- selected scaling function.  You can select
    other numbers of contours from the menu and can select this again with
    Contours->Number of Contours->Command-line spacing
    
  \item[{\tt-ps scaleval}] = scaling value by which \map{} multiplies each
    potential value as it reads from the file(s).  This option tries to
    make use of any unit information available in a time series data file
    and alters the unit value available to \map{} for display.  The
    resulting scaling of the data is permanent for the current instance of
    \map{}.
        
  \item[{\tt -ch channels-filename}] = file in {\em channels\/} format
    containing an entry for each node in the geometry which points to the
    associated location in the data array.  The value of this pointer is
    also the number that is written next to node locations when channel
    numbers are displayed.  See section~\ref{sec:leadfiles} for more
    information on the channels file format.
        
  \item[{\tt -lm landmarks-filename}] = file in {\em landmarks\/} format
    containing a set of landmark segments, divided into categories.  Each
    category has a word depicting the landmark type.  Each lines within the
    categories contains three points (x,y,z) and an associated radius,
    which may have a different effect based on the type of landmark.
    See section~\ref{sec:landmarkgeom}.

%    \item[{\tt -ch channel-links-filename}] = file in {\em channel links\/}
%          format containing an entry for each node in the geometry which
%          points to the associated location in the data array and to the
%          string array for display at that node.  See
%          section~\ref{sec:leadfiles} for more information on the 
%          channel links file format.
  
  \item[{\tt-ff fidfile}] = Ascii file containing fiducial information.
  Information may be specified for each node for an arbitrary set of 
  fiducial data.  See section~\ref{sec:fidfiles}.
      
  \item[{\tt-sl surfnum}] = surface number to which the scaling for this
    surface is to be slaved.  The idea here is to have surfaces locked in
    the way they scale and display the data; in this way, one can compare
    colors across surfaces to determine relative values of the local scalar
    data.
    
  \item[{\tt -t timesignal-lead-number}] = number of the node to be used
    for the display of a time signal in its own window.  The number refers
    to either a node number in the geometry or, if a leadlinks file is
    present, the \emph{lead} number.  This command is optionally used in
    conjunction with the -at command, to specify a node and place its
    window accordingly.  If the -at option is not present, map3d will
    choose a default window location.  Multiple invocations of this option
    are possible for each surface, providing the option to open several
    windows per surface.  At any time during the operation of the \map{}
    the user can select a new node via the pick mode menu item and have the
    time signal from that node displayed (see
    Section~\ref{sec:control-picking} for details).
    
  \item[{\tt-at xmin xmax ymin ymax}] = set the absolute location in pixels
    of a time signal window associated with the current surface.  As with
    the \texttt{-as} option, the origin is in the lower left corner of the
    screen and the full screen resolution of an SGI screen with 19-inch
    monitor typically supports 1280 by 1024 pixels.  This command is
    optionally used in conjunction with the -t command, to specify a node
    and place its window accordingly.  If the -t option is not present,
    map3d will choose a default node (the first node in the geometry).
    Multiple invocations of this option are possible for each surface,
    providing the option to open several windows per surface.

\section{Script Files}
\label{sec:scripts} 

Using script files to control map3d has numerous advantages, for example:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item complex layouts and specifications can be created and then held
        for later reuse,
  \item execution of the program reduces to a single word that starts the
        script,
  \item scripts are shell programs and can include logic and computation
        steps that automate the execution of the program; the user can even
        interact with the script and control one script to execute many
        different actions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{What are script files?}

A script files are simple programs written in the language of the Unix
shell.  There are actually several languages, one for each type of shell,
and the user is free to select.  At the CVRTI we have decided to use the
Bourne shell for script programming (and the Korn shell for interactive
use) and so all scripts will assume the associate language conventions.
The shell script language is much simpler to use and learn than a complete,
general purpose language such as C or Fortran, but is very well suited to
executing Unix commands; in fact, the script files consist mostly of lists
of commands as you might enter them at the Unix prompt.  Even more simply,
a script file can consist of nothing more than the list of commands you
would need to type to execute the same task from the system prompt.

\subsection{How to make script files}

Script files are simple text files and so are usually created with an
editor such as emacs.  You can, however, also generate a script file from a
program, or even another script.  But all script files can be read and
edited by emacs and this is the way most are composed.

To learn about the full range of possibilities in script files requires some
study of a book such as ``Unix Shell Programming'' by Kochan and Wood but
the skills needed to make \map{} script files are much more modest; any
book on Unix will contain enough information for this.  The instructions
and examples below may be enough for many users.

Here are some rules and tips that apply to script files:

\paragraph{Use a new line for each command }  This is not a requirement but
makes for simpler files that are easier to read and edit.  If the command
is longer than one line, then use a continuation character ``\\'', \eg{backslash}
\begin{verbatim}
         map3d -f geomfilename.fac \
               -p potfilename.tsdf \
              -cl channelsfilename
\end{verbatim}

{\bf Make sure that there are no characters (even blank spaces) after the
continuation character!!!}  This has to be the most frequent error when the
script file fails to run or stops abruptly.

\paragraph{Make script files executable }  Script files can be executed by
typing {\tt . scriptfile} but the simplest thing is to make then executable
files so that they work simply by typing their names. To do this, use the
{\tt chmod} command as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
         chmod 755 script_filename
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Use the .sh extension for scripts }  This convention makes it
easy to recognize shell scripts as such, but also invokes some editor help
when you edit the file in emacs.  The mode will switch to shell (much like
Fortran or C mode when editing programs with .f and .c extensions) and has
some automatic tabbing and layout tools that can be helpful.

\paragraph{Variables in scripts }  The shell script is a language and like
any computer language there are variables.  To define a variable, simply
use it and equate it to a value, \eg{}
\begin{verbatim}
         varname=2
         varname="some text"
         varname=a_name
\end{verbatim}

Do not leave any spaces around the ``='' sign or the command will fail and
set the variable to an empty string.

Once defined, the variables can be used elsewhere in the script as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
         geomdir=/u/macleod/torso/geom
         geomfile=datorso.fac
         datafile=dipole.tsdf
         map3d -f ${geomdir}/${geomfile} -p $datafile
\end{verbatim}

The curly braces are required when the variable name is concatenated with
other text of variable names but is optional otherwise.  To concatenate
text and variables you simply write them together (\eg{} {\tt
${geomdir}/${geomfile}.pts} concatenates the two variables with a ``/'' and
the extension ``.pts''.

\paragraph{Environment variables in scripts}

All the environment variables are available and can be set in the script.
For example:
\begin{verbatim}
         mydir=${HOME}
\end{verbatim}
sets the variable {\tt \$mydir} equal to the user's home directory.
Likewise,
\begin{verbatim}
         MAP3D_DATAPATH=/scratch/bt2feb93/
         export MAP3D_DATAPATH
\end{verbatim}
defines and ``exports'' the environment variable used by map3d to find
.pak files.
