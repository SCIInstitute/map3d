\section{What's New?}
\label{sec:new-features} 

In this section, we highlight the latest additions to \map{} in the
(vain?) hope that people will read at least this much of the manual
and be able to quickly make use of the latest and greatest that the program
offers.

\subsection{Version~\version{}}

This is the seventh version of the ``new'' \map{}, the latest with a Qt-based GUI.

Some of the specific additions that you should notice over previous versions
include:
%
\begin{description}
  \item [GUI improvements: ] \map{} 7.0 was rewritten in Qt.
    This was largely to help cross-platform issues that were
    arising and the deprecation of some features being relied
    on.
    Most main windows are preserved, but some GUI dialogs have
    received a face lift.
  \item [old format deprecation: ] \map{} has deprecated the old .geom, .tsdf, .data, and .tsdfc data files, in favor of matlab.
  \item [0-based or 1-based indiced: ] .fac or .mat geometries can refer to points in a 0-based or 1-based manner.
  \item [Time-dependent geometry: ] \map{} 7.2.2 has introduced time-dependent geometry.  See Section~\ref{sec:animated-mesh}
  \item [64-bit Windows support: ] \map{} 7.2.4 has introduced 64-bit binaries for Windows, enabling the use of large datasets.
  \item [Bug fixes: ] not that the previous version had any bugs, but we
    found a few(!) more things to fix.
\end{description}

\subsection{In the works (``vapourware'')}
\label{sec:vapourware}

A small sampler of things that are in the works:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Saving the frames into actual movies.
  \item Dynamic menus that indicate the current parameter selections
    (a bit more in progress).
  \item New display modes for the display of vectors.
  \item Fixing the bugs listed on the bugs page (see
    Section~\ref{sec:bugs}).
\end{itemize}
