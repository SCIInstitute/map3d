\section{What's New?}
\label{sec:new-features} 

In this section, we highlight the latest additions to \map{} in the
(vain?) hope that people will read at least this much of the manual
and be able to quickly make use of the latest and greatest that the program
offers.

\subsection{Version~\version{}: Jan, 2007}

This is the fifth version of the ``new'' \map{} with a GTK-based GUI.  We
are getting much closer to the complete functionality of the old GL
based version and have gone well beyond it in some features, especially the
user interface.  This is a ``dot'' release, and this release contains
a number of bug fixes and GUI enhancements.

Some of the specific additions that you should notice over previous versions
include:
%
\begin{description}
  \item [GUI improvements: ] Some improvements in the GUIs, particularly in the
    fiducial control and contour spacing control.  See 
    Section~\ref{sec:interactive}.
  \item [Saving Matlab Geometry: ] This version allows the user to save matlab 
    geometry files, single or multiple surfaces per file.
  \item [Displaying an image inline with the Geometry] \map{} allows an image to be
    drawn in the background of the geometry.  See Section~\ref{sec:bgimage}
  \item [Bug fixes: ] not that the previous version had any bugs, but we
    found a few(!) more things to fix.
\end{description}

\subsection{In the works (``vapourware'')}
\label{sec:vapourware}

A small sampler of things that are in the works:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Incorporating fiducials into the matlab format
  \item Saving the frames into actual movies.
  \item Dynamic menus that indicate the current parameter selections
    (a bit more in progress).
  \item New display modes for the display of vectors.
  \item Fixing the bugs listed on the bugs page (see
    Section~\ref{sec:bugs}).
\end{itemize}
