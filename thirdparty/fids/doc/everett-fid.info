FIDUCIALS, FIDUCIAL LISTS, AND FIDUCIAL SETS
--------------------------------------------

A fiducial is a parameter consisting of 2 parts: a type part and a
value part.  The type part indicates the type of fiducial,
e.g. activation, recovery, reference, etc.  The value part is the time
instance value of the fiducial.

Fiducials are organized into groups called "fiducial sets".  A
fiducial set is in turn a group of "fiducial lists".  And a fiducial
list is, well, a list of fiducials.  In everett a fiducial list holds
all fiducials for one channel of a waveform.  A fiducial list can hold
any number of any type of fiducial.  A fiducial set then is merely a
collection of fiducial lists, one list per channel.

Everett gives you great flexibility in organizing your fiducials
within fiducial sets. It's up to you to decide how best to organize
them.


DATA FILES, TIME SERIES DATA, AND FIDUCIAL SETS
------------------------------------------

Data files maintain a list of time series data.  These data may be
internal or external to the data file.  Data files also contain
fiducial sets.  For each time series the data file maintains a list of
fiducial sets.  Thus there may be 1 or more fiducial sets per time
series.  

Usually each fiducial set will have the same number of channels
(i.e. the same number of fiducial lists) as the time series data.
This is not necessary though.  For instance, you may want to save a
global reference fiducial derived from an rms waveform.  To do this
you would compute the rms waveform, then create an associated fiducial
set, and then select a reference time and add it to the fiducial set.
This fiducial set can then be saved with all the others.  Another
example would be 32 lead body surface data.  You could generate 192
lead time series data from the 32 lead data using the limited lead
expansion plugin.  Then you could generate 1 or more 192 lead fiducial
sets from these data.  Then you could save the 192 lead fiducial sets
without having to save the 192 lead time series data.

When everett opens a data set it does not read any fiducial sets. When
everett opens a time series it reads all fiducial sets for that
timeseries.  You can then edit the fiducials within any of the
fiducial sets, create new fiducial sets, and even delete fiducials
sets.  You can save the changes.  Deleted fiducial sets will not be in
the updated data file.  Everett does not delete the original data
file.  It renames it by appending ".bak" to its file name.  The
updated file will have the same name as the original.

When everett opens the next time series it first gives you a chance to
save modified fiducial sets if you have not already done so.  Then
everett will purge all current waveform and fiducial data from memory
and read the next time series data and all associated fiducial sets.


CREATING FIDUCIAL SETS
----------------------

Everett gives you 2 ways to create fiducial sets.  Invoking a fiducial
generating plugin from the "Generate" menu will create a new fiducial
set.  Fiducials computed by the plugin will be saved in the new
fiducial set.  Everett will automatically generate a name for the
fiducial set and this name will appear in the menus that display
fiducial set names.

You can create a fiducial set manually be selecting the "New Fiducial
Set" menu item.  You must give the fiducial set a name of your own
choosing.  You can only create a new fiducial set in conjunction with
a waveform.  That is you must be displaying a waveform before you can
create a new fiducial set.  Everett will create a fiducial set having
the same number of channels as the waveform.


WAVEFORMS + FIDUCIAL SETS = LINKING + OTHER BORING STUFF
--------------------------------------------------------

To display fiducials with a waveform you must "link" them together
using the "Link" menu item.  Each waveform maintains a list of
fiducial sets that are linked to it.  Therefore you may link 1 or more
fiducial sets to a waveform (assuming they are all compatible with the
waveform).  Different waveforms may be linked to the same fiducial
set.

In a waveform's list of linked fiducial sets there is always one
that is considered the "current" fiducial set.  You may choose which
one this is.  The notion of a current fiducial set is useful in two
contexts.  First, if you want to add fiducials to an existing fiducial
set you must first make that fiducial set the current one.  Then you
can add fiducials to it by selecting a fiducial generating plugin from
the "Generate To Current" menu or you can add fiducials manually using
the "Add" menu item.  Second, some waveform generating plugins require
fiducials as input.  Before invoking one of these plugins you must
first make an appropriate fiducial set the current one.  Everett will
then pass this fiducial set to the plugin.  Most plugins don't require
a fiducial set as input so you don't normally need to worry about
selecting a current fiducial set before invoking the plugin.


CONCLUSION
----------

I can't think of anything else to say right now.  Actually, there is
lots more to say and I'll say it another day.  In the meantime give
the new everett a try.  I tried to flush out as many bugs as possible
but I'm sure there are more.  As always, constructive criticism is
welcome.  Unconstructive criticism sucks.  Keep it to yourself.
