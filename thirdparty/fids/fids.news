I you are dealing with lead by lead fiducials, this may interest you.

  Introduction 

  What is a Fids File? 

A fids file contains fiducial frame numbers from each lead of mapping
data.  The potentials are usually stored in .data files and there we have
fiducials that apply to the whole beat, that is, the same value applies to
every lead in the mapping array.  Eventually, the information in fids files
will migrate to the .data files too, but in the meantime---and thereafter
if experience is any guide---we have fids files.

A fids file is in ASCII format, and hence can be easily created by anything
from a text editor to awk, C, and Fortran programs.  The disadvantage is
that ASCII files are large and there is less control of format.  What this
means in practice is that the routines in the fids library may fail because
the file is not quite in the correct format.  The errors causing the
failure may be hard to find, harder than if this were a binary file.  But
this is the price of simplicity and easy access.

  What is this library? 

This library offers some routines to manage fids files, especially reading
existing fids files into a data structure defined for this purpose.  I hope
they make programs a little easier to write and perhaps exert some gentle
pressure towards a standard approach to these files.  At least it makes my
life easier as I have written several program using the library and will
probably have more in the near future.
