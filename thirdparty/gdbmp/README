---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE : THESE FILES HAVE BEEN ALTERED !!!!!!

THIS VERSION OF THE GDBM LIBRARY HAS BEEN PATCHED FOR CVRTI SO IT WORKS ON
MUTLIPLE PLATFORMS WITH A CROSS PLATFORM COMPATIBLE FILEFORMAT.
THE ORIGINAL LIBRARY DID NOT HANDLE BYTESWAPPING, INTEGER ALIGNMENT IN
A PLATFORM INPENDENT WAY. THIS HAS BEEN FIXED IN THE FILES PRESENT IN THIS
DIRECTORY.

MODIFACTIONS WERE MADE MARCH 15th 2004 BY JG Stinstra AT CVRTI

THESE MODIFICATIONS ARE DESIGNED TO HAVE A PLATFORM INDEPENDENT VERSION
OF GDBM AT CVRTI. THE MODIFICATIONS ARE MARKED IN EVERY FILE THAT HAD
TO BE FIXED TO SUPPORT A CROSS PLATFORM INDEPENDENT FILE FORMAT.
